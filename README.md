# Render Scripts for Blender

This script renders all collections under the "Container" parent collection.

## How it works
It will loop through every collection under the Container and one by one turn each collection on, render every camera in your scene and move on to the next collection. It saves your images under a "Renders/" folder in the same folder as your blend file. Each collection is stored as a sub folder within it.
